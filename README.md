# Starter kit Lit Element

Building 
	

 1. Test: Cypress
 2. Demo: storybook
 3. Building: Webpack, Babel, Lit Element
 
 I share this little starter kit, since it cost me a lot to find help to work with web components. 

#### For the testing:
Cypress that helps **mocha** and **chai** for unit testing , we also incorporate the Page Object design pattern for test abstraction.

#### For the Demo
storybook, it helps us to build a demo of the component as well as its documentation.

#### For Building
We use webpack to mount the building and we transpile the code with babel

#### Use

install Package
```
npm i
```

npm run dev
