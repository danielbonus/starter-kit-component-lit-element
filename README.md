# Started kit Lit Element

Building 
	

 1. Test: Cypress
 2. Demo: storybook
 3. Building: Web pack, Babel, Lit Element
 
 I share this little starter kit, since it cost me a lot to find help to work with web components. 

#### For the testig:
Cypress that helps **mocha** and **chai** for unit teting , we also incorporate the Page Object design pattern for test abstraction.

#### For the Demo
storyboo, it helps us to build a demo of the component as well as its documentation.

#### For Building
We use webpack to mount the buildong and we transpile the code with babel
